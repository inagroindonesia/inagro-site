<h3 id="tedong-saleko">Tedong  Saleko</h3>

<p>In Tana Toraja, South Sulawesi, there are special buffalos this type of buffalo is called Tedong Saleko. Special, in this Tana Toraja Saleko cultural environment is Tedong with the highest caste in it’s very rare existence and possesses different physical characteristics than the common buffalo such as the yellow horn, the white circle in the eyeball, and the black and white skin in combinations certain. No half-hearted, because of its privilege, the price of this buffalo can reach 1 billion rupiah,Wow!
A male saleko buffalo mated to a female Saleko does not necessarily give birth to a boy Saleko, even in dozens of births. Instead, Saleko can emerge from the marriage of a pair of ordinary buffalo. Wow, that&rsquo;s really rare, yes.
The people of Tana Toraja believe Tedong is a vehicle for the spirit to Puya (the world of spirits, or the afterlife). Buffalo also has a unique position for the Toraja community. It is farmed and as a means of plowing the fields, at the same time considered sacred animals and social status symbols.
Buffalo is considered the highest offering for Toraja indigenous people who died, through solo rituals. Rambu Solo is done for days, even there for weeks, and attended by thousands of citizens. One of the important rituals is the slaughter of buffalo.
In the belief of Aluk To Dolo, or ancient Toraja religion, the &lsquo;solo sign&rsquo; is done by noble families. The higher the nobility, the bigger and the bigger the event. Later this ritual can also by non-nobles. The more rare the sacrificed buffalo, it shows the higher social strata of the buried person.</p>

<p>In addition as a buffalo slaughter, because of his burly body shape is the type of buffalo is usually used as buffalo fighter. Often Tedong Pudu&rsquo;s fighting ability is used in the event of Ma&rsquo;palisaga Tedong (buffalo fight) which is one of the series of Rambu Solo ceremonies. The event Ma&rsquo;palisaga Tedong in Rambu Solo became excited and filled with people who want to watch this unique spectacle. Usually a winning buffalo has its own priorities that boost its selling price. However, as expensive as a Tedong Pudu is not enough to rival the price of Tedong Bonga. The price ranges from tens to Rp 100 million, for the price of buffalo fighter more expensive until hundreds of million rupiah.</p>
